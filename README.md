A fun word-guessing game built with **React** where you must protect programming languages from Assembly by guessing the correct word in under 8 attempts!

##  Project Overview

**Assembly: Endgame** is an interactive React app that displays a list of programming languages and challenges the player to guess a hidden word before running out of attempts.

This project demonstrates how React handles:
- Component rendering  
- Dynamic list creation  
- Inline styling with JavaScript objects  
- JSX syntax and expression embedding  

It’s designed as a simple learning project for beginners exploring modern React.
